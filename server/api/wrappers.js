/**
  This module includes wrappers for auto-generated API facade classes.

  Wrappers are class decorators, accepting a facade class and returning a
  modified, improved version of the facade. Wrappers are useful when the
  auto-generated facade includes ugly or difficult to use calls. A wrapper can
  extend or override the method set for facades to make the resulting API more
  user friendly.

  Nothing must be done in order to activate wrappers, as they are automatically
  loaded by auto-generated modules.
